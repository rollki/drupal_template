## Installation via Lando
First you need to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io).
After that you can start an app in cloned project:
```
lando start
```
Next step is to launch script with project installation:
```
lando ssh
bash scripts/site-install-via-lando.sh
```
And voila - the project is installed. You can find urls to the site, by typing command:

```
